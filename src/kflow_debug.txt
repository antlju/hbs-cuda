PROBLEM: Can't reproduce CPU convergence to umax 0.5 for f0=1/40, N=128, nu=1/20.
For these timestep settings GPU code diverges. For smaller timesteps the code oscillates ie doesn't come to steady state.

ustar and divustar have the correct values for:
dt, rho, alphak, betak, gammak (on proper rk substeps).

I tried replacing ustar loop over vi and gammak optimisation: still diverges.


Since our forcing is f= f0*sin(y) when we take the divergence of ustar we always get zero. Let us skip the whole pressure/psi/fft step and see what we get.

I seem to have found the issue! Two things:
1. I didn't factor in viscosity when calculating vlapl in RHSk kernel.
2. I didn't _set_ the RHSk in the first calc (udotgradu) but rather I added it to the previous result -> divergence ofcourse!
